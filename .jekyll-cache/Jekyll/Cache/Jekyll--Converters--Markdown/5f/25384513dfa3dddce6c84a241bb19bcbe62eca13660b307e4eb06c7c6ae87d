<p>Iâ€™ve been involved in academic research since high school, where I worked under the supervision of Albert Einstein College of Medicine with <a href="https://www.einsteinmed.edu/faculty/3662/joel-friedman/"> Joel Friedman </a> and directly under Mahantesh Navati and Camille LaRoche. There I worked on the synthesis of hemoglobin-containing solution-gelatins and sugar glasses to test reactions with nitric oxides.</p>
