I""<p>The release of ChatGPT in 2022 and GPT-4 this year has put artificial intelligence and machine learning in the public spotlight. These advances are due to the development and deployment of Large Language Model (LLMs), deep neural networks trained on millions of examples. Before the GPTs, image generation and protein folding models had also effectively harnessed LLM architectures. For the average computer and internet user, however, the ability to use natural language interact with computational systems will have the greatest impact.</p>
