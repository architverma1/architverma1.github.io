<p>I am a Bioinformatics Fellow at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco. I am advised by Dr. Barbara Engelhardt. Previously I worked as a Data Science Consultant for IBM Federal, completed my PhD in Chemical and Biological Engineering at Princeton, and completed a Bachelors of Science in Engineering at Duke University in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Economics.</p>

<p>I am excited about developing machine learning and statistical models to tackle challenging biological experimental data. An engineer by training, I am interested in applying optimization techniques to design novel biology and chemistry. My current work primarily focuses on applying ML techniques to two biological areas: proteins and spatial imaging. I am also excited about statistical modeling for more societal level applications, such as work on a <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/10190/101900E/A-generative-model-for-predicting-terrorist-incidents/10.1117/12.2264909.full"> generative model for terrorism </a>  and the consulting work at IBM. For more about my current and past projects, check out the <a href="research.md">Research</a> page.</p>

<p>I am also interested in applying biotechnology to help mitigate the impacts of climate change. Together with <a href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/our-scientists/independent-fellows/10009-benjamin-weiner/">Ben Weiner</a>, I write the <a href="https://reductase.substack.com/">Reductase</a> blog on Substack exploring the technical and economic challenges in developing novel biology for climate technologies. Parts of these posts will also be availble on the <a href="blog.html">blog</a> section of this site.</p>
