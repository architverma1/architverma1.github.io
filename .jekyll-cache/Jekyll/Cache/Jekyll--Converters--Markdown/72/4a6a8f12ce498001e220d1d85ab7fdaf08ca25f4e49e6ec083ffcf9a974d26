<p>I am a post-doc at the Gladstone Institutes with Dr. Barbara Engelhardt. My research focus is  currently developing machine learning methods for protein engineering, wiwith the hope of improving protein eningeering abilities for addressing issues in climate change and sustainability.</p>

<p>I hope to use this site for a mix of professional and personal content.</p>

<p>For more about my professional journey, check out the About Me page. For a summary of my research work, try the Research page. I expect to start a research blog soon as well with some musings on different topics and trends in academia, industry, and society.</p>

<p>I love to cook, and am particularly interested in the different spices that define different cuisines. I will be trying to write regular posts on different spices I use in my meals and random spices I come across in life. I’ll attempt to make sense of the history, economics, and cultural origins of each spice as well as the chemistry underlying their flavors. I’m hoping to manifest my own travel food show, so if you end up finding the content interesting tell any food network executives you know! Finally, I’ve recently gotten more into photography and will share some of my favorites as time permits.</p>
