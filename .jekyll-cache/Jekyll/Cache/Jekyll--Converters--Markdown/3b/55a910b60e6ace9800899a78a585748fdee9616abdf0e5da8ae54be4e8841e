<h2 id="my-research-journey">My research journey</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve been involved in academic research since high school, where I worked under the supervision of Albert Einstein College of Medicine with <a href="https://www.einsteinmed.edu/faculty/3662/joel-friedman/"> Joel Friedman </a> and directly under Mahantesh Navati and Camille LaRoche. There I worked on the synthesis of hemoglobin-containing solution-gelatins and sugar glasses to test reactions with nitric oxides.</p>

<p>After high school, I followed this interest in biology with a Biomedical Engineering major at Duke University. I joined <a href="https://bme.duke.edu/faculty/ashutosh-chilkoti"> Ashutosh Chilkotiâ€™s </a> group and worked with Kelli Lubinguhl and Jayanta Bhattacharyya on a variety of projects cented on improving drug delivery with elastin-like polypeptides. Target drugs included the biological betatrophin for diabetes and paclitaxel and gemcitabine for cancer.</p>

<p>In my doctoral work I transitioned to a computational role, advised by Dr. Barbara Engelhardt in the Princeton Computer Science department. I combined my engineering experience with machine learning tools to answer questions about bulk RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and live cell imaging with statistical methods.</p>
