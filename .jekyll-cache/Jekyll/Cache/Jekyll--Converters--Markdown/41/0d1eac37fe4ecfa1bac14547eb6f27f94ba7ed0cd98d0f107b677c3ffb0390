I"ë<p>The release of ChatGPT in 2022 and GPT-4 this year has put artificial intelligence and machine learning in the public spotlight. Image generators and protein folding models also brought ML to the forefront in the last few years, but the potential to seamlessly use natural language to interact with computers and the internet will have the greatest reach. These advances are due to the development of Large Language Model (LLMs), deep neural networks trained on millions of examples.</p>
