<p><em>with <a href="https://sidujena.github.io"> Siddartha Jena </a></em></p>

<p>Cells are under constant pressure to integrate information from both their environment and internal cellular processes. However, these effects often use the same signaling pathways, making autonomous and coupled signaling difficult to decouple from one another. We present a statistical modeling framework, the cellular point process (CPP), that decouples these two modes of signaling using videos of living, actively signaling cells as input. Our model reveals modulation of autonomous and coupled signaling parameters in a number of contexts ranging from pharmacological treatment to wound healing that were previously unavailable. The CPP enhances our understanding of cellular information processing and can be extended to a wide range of systems. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2026123118">link</a></p>

<p>Modern developments in single-cell sequencing technologies enable broad insights into cellular state. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to explore cell types, states, and developmental trajectories to broaden our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in tissues and organs. Analysis of these sparse, high-dimensional experimental results requires dimension reduction. Several methods have been developed to estimate low-dimensional embeddings for filtered and normalized single-cell data. However, methods have yet to be developed for unfiltered and unnormalized count data that estimate uncertainty in the low-dimensional space. We present a nonlinear latent variable model with robust, heavy-tailed error and adaptive kernel learning to estimate low-dimensional nonlinear structure in scRNA-seq data. <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03625-z">link</a></p>

<h4 id="a-bayesian-nonparametric-semi-supervised-model-for-integration-of-multiple-single-cell-experiments">A Bayesian nonparametric semi-supervised model for integration of multiple single-cell experiments</h4>
<p>Joint analysis of multiple single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) data is confounded by technical batch effects across experiments, biological or environmental variability across cells, and different capture processes across sequencing platforms. Manifold alignment is a principled, effective tool for integrating multiple data sets and controlling for confounding factors. We demonstrate that the semi-supervised t-distributed Gaussian process latent variable model (sstGPLVM), which projects the data onto a mixture of fixed and latent dimensions, can learn a unified low-dimensional embedding for multiple single cell experiments with minimal assumptions. We show the efficacy of the model as compared with state-of-the-art methods for single cell data integration on simulated data, pancreas cells from four sequencing technologies, induced pluripotent stem cells from male and female donors, and mouse brain cells from both spatial seqFISH+ and traditional scRNA-seq.</p>

<h2 id="my-research-journey">My research journey</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve been involved in academic research since high school, where I worked under the supervision of Albert Einstein College of Medicine with <a href="https://www.einsteinmed.edu/faculty/3662/joel-friedman/"> Joel Friedman </a> and directly under Mahantesh Navati and Camille LaRoche. There I worked on the synthesis of hemoglobin-containing solution-gelatins and sugar glasses to test reactions with nitric oxides.</p>

<p>After high school, I followed this interest in biology with a Biomedical Engineering major at Duke University. I joined <a href="https://bme.duke.edu/faculty/ashutosh-chilkoti"> Ashutosh Chilkotiâ€™s </a> group and worked with Kelli Lubinguhl and Jayanta Bhattacharyya on a variety of projects cented on improving drug delivery with elastin-like polypeptides. Target drugs included the biological betatrophin for diabetes and paclitaxel and gemcitabine for cancer.</p>

<p>In my doctoral work I transitioned to a computational role, advised by Dr. Barbara Engelhardt in the Princeton Computer Science department. I combined my engineering experience with machine learning tools to answer questions about bulk RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and live cell imaging with statistical methods.</p>

<p>After my completing my PhD in 2021 I joined IBM as a data scientist in the Federal Analytics and Cognitive Consulting division. My work there focused on detecting anomalies in ship tracking data and predicting medical supply shortages from time series data.</p>

<p>I returned to work with Dr. Engelhardt as a Bioinformatics Fellow in 2022 to return to my biology roots. I am currently working primarily on protein phenotype prediction and</p>
